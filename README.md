- **Dynamic Metadata**: Automatically generates SEO-friendly metadata based on Pokémon profiles for improved social sharing.
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly messages when data from the API is unavailable.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Uses Next.js `Link` and `useRouter` to provide a seamless navigation experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used
